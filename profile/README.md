# Hello, World! 👋

&nbsp;

Hey! I am Siri. I am a Frontend Engineer working for Bumble Inc in London, UK 🇬🇧. Originally, I hail from India 🇮🇳 from the beautiful city of [Thiruvananthapuram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram)🌴 in coastal Kerala. Ever since 2011, my job has taken me around the world to work for some great organisations amongst some of the best minds in the world thanks to the passion I found with web technologies.

At Bumble, I work in the Design Systems team where we create and maintain all the design elements that you see in the app and website and all the infrasturcture around it.

Outside of work, I travel regularly and have so far been to about 15 countries in South Asia, Middle East and Europe. I cook, mostly Indian, but I am expanding my repertoire to other cuisines. I speak a few languages - Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, and English. I have learnt a bit of Sanskrit and Deutsch too. I play a lot of cricket 🏏 during the summer months. I also run, swim, play tennis, badminton, football and table tennis. I tend to have strong opinions on socio-political issues around the world, sometimes controversial. I am meticulous and abmitious and I move steadfast towards my goals. I am also enroute getting my private pilots license. Its the high octane activity I engage in which takes my mind away from code and computers sometimes.
